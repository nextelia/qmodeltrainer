about=QModel Trainer brings deep learning model training directly into QGIS. Train SMP, Mask R-CNN and YOLO 11 models. Features include data augmentation, learning rate finder, resume training, early stopping, and comprehensive HTML reports. Part of QGeoAI Tools suite - requires QGeoAI Server for PyTorch/CUDA acceleration. Export trained models to QMTP format for seamless use with QPredict. Supports both GPU (CUDA) and CPU training with automatic hardware detection.
